# Changes
by OS, 30.06.2018

- completely removed #38 (incomplete data files because of aborted experimental run)


- removed whitespace in filenames of #69


- renamed first #65 duplicate to #401


- renamed second #106 duplicate to #402



IMPORTANT: The data files have not been opened. So the renamed files (s. above) will still have the wrong participant number in the field 'subject'! They have to be changed in all three files per participant to the subject number as stated in the file name (first number after the underscore).
