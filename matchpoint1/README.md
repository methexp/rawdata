From Klauer and Musch (2002):
 
EXPERIMENTS 1 TO 4

The experiments of the first series are modeled after experiments by Tipper, Weaver, and Houghton (1994), who used similar procedures to demonstrate the goal dependence of attentional processes in the context of so-called negative priming (e.g., Fox, 1995). The principle of the experiments is simple. Words are used that differ in two dimensions: with respect to valence (negative vs. positive) and with respect to a second, orthogonal dimension. In Experiments 1 to 4, the second dimension is spanned, respectively, by two locations on the screen (Experiment 1), two colors of presentation (Experiment 2), letter case (lower case vs. upper case; Experiment 3), and grammatical category (adjective vs. noun; Experiment 4). Consider Experiment 1, in which the second dimension is given by two locations of presentation on the screen. Prime and target can be consistent or inconsistent with respect to evaluation. With respect to location, they also can be consistent (presentation at the same location) or inconsistent (presentation at different locations). Both kinds of consistency are manipulated orthogonally.  In Experiment 1, two groups of participants worked on different tasks and with different current goals. Members of the first group were to judge the evaluation (or for the control trials, the gender) of the target, whereas members of the second group were to indicate at which of two possible locations the target was presented. This same logic applied to Experiments 2 to 4, in which other irrelevant dimensions and associated decision tasks were used. In Experiment 4, the irrelevant dimension was given by the grammatical class of the words: The evaluatively polarized words could be either nouns or adjectives. Because first names are always nouns, it was not possible to use the control material and the gender decision task in that experiment.

- Words differ by:
  - First dimension:
    - positive versus negative (experimental trials)
    - female versus male (control trials)
  - (orthogonal) second dimension:
    - two locations on the screen
    - color of presentation
    - lower case versus upper case
    - adjective versus noun

# Method

Each participant underwent two experimental phases with different materials. In one phase, evaluatively polarized adjectives were used as stimuli. In the other phase, first names were used. The order of the two phases was counterbalanced across participants in each group. In Experiment 4, there was only the phase using evaluatively polarized adjectives and nouns. In addition to valence or gender, words differed with respect to a second dimension as already detailed. Prime-target consistency with respect to valence (gender) was manipulated orthogonally to prime-target consistency with respect to the second dimension. Participants either made evaluative and gender decisions (first group) or judged the target's value on the second dimension (second group). In Experiment 1, stimuli were presented on the screen in one of two adjacent rows, labeled the upper and the lower line. In Experiment 2, stimuli were presented in one of two colors, blue or brown. In Experiment 3, stimuli were presented in one of two letter cases (lower case vs. upper case). In Experiment 4, stimuli stemmed from two different grammatical categories, that is, they were either adjectives or nouns. Only capital letters were used for displaying both adjectives and nouns in this experiment.

## Participants

Participants were University of Bonn students with different majors and nonstudent volunteers of a similar age range recruited by the experimenters. Students received either partial course credit or were paid DM10 (approximately U.S.$6 at the time) for their participation. Nonstudent volunteers participated in exchange for detailed individual feedback on their results.
All participants were native speakers of German and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
There were 32 participants in each experiment.
~~Two participants held down one response key throughout the experiment.
They were dropped from the analyses and replaced by new participants. Thus, the total number of participants retained for analysis in Experiments 1 to 4 was 128. Participants in each experiment were assigned to two groups of 16 participants each, according to a random assignment procedure.~~

## Material

The study used 70 male and 70 female names that were typical of their gender and easy to recognize based on a pilot study described in Musch and Klauer (2001). An additional constraint was that only names with a length of three to eight letters were eligible. Furthermore, 70 strongly positive and 70 strongly negative adjectives were selected from a pool of polarized adjectives used in previous affective priming experiments (e.g., Klauer et al., 1997) with the restriction that each word had between three and nine letters. Finally, strongly valenced nouns were selected for Experiment 4, based on norms for 800 German nouns (Schwibbe, Röder, Schwibbe, Borchardt, & Geiken-Pophanken, 1981). Those nouns rated as most positive or most negative were selected with the restriction that the number of letters of each word was between three and nine, yielding a pool of 30 strongly positive and 30 strongly negative nouns. In Experiment 4, as in Experiment 8 to be reported later, the nouns were supplemented by 30 strongly positive and 30 strongly negative adjectives, taken from the above pool of 70 positive and 70 negative adjectives. Thus, there were equal numbers of stimuli from each grammatical category (adjectives vs. nouns).

## List Construction

For each participant, a new list of prime-target pairs was constructed. Each participant's list consisted of blocks of 48 prime-target pairs (and a couple of practice blocks of 32 prime-target pairs constructed analogously). Blocks were either based on the evaluatively polarized material or on the first-names material. In each evaluative block, 48 positive and 48 negative words were used. They were randomly sampled without replacement from the pools of 70 positive and 70 negative adjectives (in Experiment 4: from the pools of 30 positive and 30 negative nouns and 30 positive and 30 negative adjectives). Any given word occurred at most once in a given block. The blocks followed a balanced 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 design with respect to the values of prime and target on the valence dimension and on the second dimension. The order of pairs was randomized within each block. The blocks based on the first-names material were constructed completely analogously, with male first names taking the role of positive words and female first names taking the role of negative words.

## Response Window Procedure

Participants had a window of 133 ms duration, initially centered at 400 ms after target onset, within which they were to respond to the target item. To tailor the window center to each participant's performance and to adapt to changes in performance accuracy over the course of the experiment, an adaptive procedure modeled closely after Greenwald et al. (1996) was used, in which the window center was adjusted contingent on the participant's performance. **The details of the adaptive procedure are described in Musch and Klauer (2001)**.  The background color of the screen was light gray. Primes were presented in black for 57 ms. The prime words were then replaced by a blank string displayed for 14 ms followed by the target word, which also was displayed in black. In Experiment 2, primes and targets were presented in blue or brown in all those cases in which their color was black under the standard presentation conditions. The 71-ms interval between prime onset and target onset defined the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the priming task. For each kind of material (adjectives vs. names), participants completed 6 blocks of 48 experimental trials preceded by 5 to 12 practice blocks as determined by the adaptive procedure.

- Trial sequence:
  - t = 0        : prime onset
  - t = 57ms     : replaced with "blank screen"
  - t = 71ms     : target onset (57 + 14 = 71ms = SOA)
  - t = 71ms + x : response window onset (initial x = 333ms, target word changes to yellow)
  - t = 71ms + x + 133ms: response window offset (initial center of response window = 400ms after target onset)


## From Musch and Klauer (2001)

### Trial sequence

Window onset was signaled by a change in color of the target word from black to yellow.
Feedback for success was provided by the target's behavior.

**If the response occurred before onset of the response window**, the target never changed to yellow.

**If the response was not too early**, the target changed to yellow 333ms after target onset,
marking the beginning of the 133ms response window.

**If the response occurred during the window**, the target word changed from yellow to white and remained white for 300ms.
The screen was then cleared and the next trial was initiated after an additional 400ms had passed.

**If no response was made during the response window**,
the target word changed black again for 300ms after the end of the response window.
The screen was then cleared, and the next trial was initiated after an additional 400ms interval.

### Adaptation

In all experiments, the adaptive response window was initially centered at 400 ms after onset of the target word. At the end of each block, the window center could decrease by 33 ms, increase by 33 ms, or could remain unchanged, depending on the participant's performance in that block. Following Draine and Greenwald (1998), the window center was made shorter if the error percentage was less than or equal to 20% and the participant's mean response latency for that block did not exceed the current window by more than 100 ms. The window center was made longer if the participant's error percentage was greater than or equal to 45% and the mean response latency exceeded the current window center by more than 100 ms. If neither of these sets of conditions was met, the window center was not changed. Only trials in which the participant responded in the interval between 100 ms and 1000 ms after target onset were included in determining percentage correct scores.

### Practice and eperimental blocks

Participants completed five to twelve blocks of practice trials prior to the experimental trials for each kind of material (adjectives vs. names, respectively). During the first two blocks of 36 practice trials each, no distractor stimuli were displayed (blank fields were presented in their place), and the response window was not used. Participants were free to respond however quickly or slowly they desired in order to practice their task. They were given feedback at the end of each trial as to whether they entered the correct response or not. The following blocks of 36 practice trials added the response window to the procedures of the first two practice blocks. At the beginning of each practice and experimental block with the response window, six additional dummy trials consisting of the same kind of stimulus pairs were presented. Participants were instructed to observe these trials without giving a response so that they could adjust to the temporal placement of the response window. The start of the 36 practice trials in each block was indicated by a beep of the computer's internal speaker. Participants had to perform a minimum of three practice blocks with the response window prior to each of the two phases of experimental blocks in the experiment. They continued practicing until no further adaptation of the window center was necessary or until a maximum number of ten practice blocks using the response window was reached. For each kind of material (adjectives vs. names), following the practice trials, participants completed six blocks of 48 experimental trials each. Thus, for both adjectives and names, analyses were performed on 6 × 48 = 288 experimental trials. After each practice and experimental block, participants were informed of their percentage of correct responses and were advised that, although relatively high error rates could normally occur, they should nevertheless try to respond as accurately as possible. Participants were allowed to rest briefly between each practice and experimental block. The sessions of each experiment lasted about 45 minutes.

### Experiment I1: Prüfung eines Affective Matching-Effekts im GDH-Paradigma

Experiment I1 repliziert den GDH-Lerneffekt mit maskierten Reizen und prüft, inwiefern er nicht nur in der Valenzklassifikationsaufgabe, sondern auch in einer Matching-Aufgabe nachweisbar ist. Findet im GDH-Paradigma affektives Lernen statt, sollte sich dieses automatisch auf die „gleich“/„verschieden“-Urteile in der Matching-Aufgabe auswirken (Klauer & Musch, 2002): Der automatische Affective-Matching-Mechanismus erleichtert "gleich"-Urteile (und erschwert "verschieden"-Urteile) für Reize derselben Valenz, wenn die aufgabenrelevante Vergleichsdimension nicht-evaluativ ist (z.B. Bildschirmposition). Die Matching-Aufgabe wird wie bei Klauer und Musch implementiert; als Manipulation Check werden zusätzliche Trials mit präexperimentell valenten Reizen präsentiert. Die aufgabenrelevante Dimension wird variiert (Schriftfarbe bzw. Groß-/Kleinschreibung; vgl. Klauer & Musch, 2002). Die Reihenfolge der abhängigen Maße (Valenzklassifikation, Matching) wird ausbalanciert. Zuletzt wird die objektive Identifizierbarkeit der maskierten CSs erfasst. Der GDH-Lerneffekt war in unseren bisherigen Studien mit 90 Vpn robust replizierbar. Um auch kleinere Effekte zu entdecken, werden 2x90=180 Vpn erhoben. Es wird ein 2 (Reihenfolge der AVn) x 2 (aufgabenrelevante Dimension) – Design realisiert.

- aufgabenrelevante Dimension:
  - Schriftfarbe
  - Groß-/Kleinschreibung
- match vs. nonmatch von prime und target:
  - Valenz (positiv, negativ, neutral???)
  - aufgabenrelevante Dimension (gleiche Farbe / gleiches letter case)

### Experiment I2: Manipulation der relevanten Kategorisierungsdimension

In Experiment I2 wird die Instruktion in der Lernaufgabe variiert, um zu prüfen, ob affektiv-evaluatives und/oder response-category-Lernen im GDH-Paradigma zielunabhängig ist. Eine Valenz-
Lernbedingung (positiv/negativ) wird mit einer Wortart-Lernbedingung (Adjektiv/Nomen) verglichen. In beiden Bedingungen werden dieselben Reizpaare präsentiert (CS1+ → positives Adjektiv; CS2- → negatives Adjektiv; CS3+ → positives Nomen; CS4- → negatives Nomen). In der
Testphase werden sowohl Valenz- als auch Wortart-Klassifikationsblöcke realisiert. Ist ein Valenz-Lerneffekt auch in der Wortart-Lernbedingung nachweisbar (bzw. ein Wortart-Lerneffekt in
der Valenz-Lernbedingung), spräche dies für zielunabhängiges Lernen. Zusätzlich wird, wie in
Exp.I1, eine Matching-Aufgabe implementiert, um die affektiv-evaluative Natur des Lerneffekts
zu prüfen (die Valenz-Lernbedingung stellt damit eine Replikation von Exp. I1 dar). Die Daten
der Wortart-Lernbedingung sind für die weitergehende Frage relevant, inwiefern ein Affective-Matching-Effekt (auch bzw.) nur in Abwesenheit eines bewussten Valenz-Verarbeitungsziels nachweisbar ist.
Es wird ein 2 (Klassifikationsaufgabe: Valenz vs. Wortart) x 2 (Reihenfolge der AVn)-Design mit 180 Vpn erhoben.

###Experiment I3: Itemspezifische Reiz-Reaktions-Instruktionen

Experiment I3 ist als Replikation und Erweiterung von Exp. I1 & I2 geplant. Zusätzlich zu einer
Kontrollbedingung (Replikation I1/I2; GDH-Paradigma mit zusätzlicher Matching-Aufgabe) werden (between-subjects) zwei weitere Lernbedingungen realisiert, in der keine Kategorisierungsaufgabe zu bearbeiten ist, sondern eine 1:1-Zuordnung von CS zum spezifischen US/Zielreiz
instruiert wird (S-R-Regel; Longman et al., 2018). Dabei werden dieselben Reizpaare wie in Exp. I2 verwendet (CS1+ → positives Adjektiv; CS2- → negatives Adjektiv; CS3+ → positives Nomen;
CS4- → negatives Nomen). Findet eine automatische Assoziation der CS mit der Valenz des US
statt, sollte die S-R-Regel den Lerneffekt intakt lassen. Handelt es sich um zielabhängiges Lernen, sollte der Valenz-Lerneffekt verschwinden. Die S-R-Regeln in den beiden itemspezifischen
Lernbedingungen unterscheiden sich darin, ob die beiden CSs derselben Valenz auf dieselbe
Antworttaste (Valenzkompatible Zuordnung: CS1+ & CS3+ → linke Taste; CS2- & CS4- → rechte
Taste) oder auf unterschiedliche Antworttasten gemappt werden (Valenzinkompatible Zuord-
nung: CS1+ & CS4- → linke Taste; CS2- & CS3+ → rechte Taste). Ein Vergleich der Bedingungen
gibt Hinweise auf mögliche spontane Rekodierungseffekte: Im ersten Fall könnten die itemspezifischen Regeln spontan in eine Valenzkategorisierungsaufgabe („positiv → linke Taste; negativ
→ rechte Taste“) rekodiert werden; im zweiten Fall ist dies nicht möglich. Es wird erneut eine
Matching-AV erhoben, um affektiv-evaluative Lerneffekte zu prüfen, die durch die bewusste Verarbeitung kategorialer Information in der Lernphase von Exp. I2 möglicherweise unterdrückt wurden. Design: 3 (Instruktionsbedingung: Valenzklassifikation; Valenzkompatibles S-R-Mapping; Valenzinkompatibles S-R-Mapping) x 2 (Reihenfolge der AVn) mit 270 Vpn.


## Offene Fragen

- Für welche Reize werden die CSs verwendet? (nur prime, nur target, sowohl prime als auch target, oder sowohl primes als auch targets aus CSs und Kontrollitems?)
- Wie wird in der Lernphase das *response window* angezeigt?
  - Sollten wir das zwischen Klassifikations- und Matching-Aufgabe angleichen?
